## Ensemble Learning and Boosting Techniques

This repository contains the code for an assignment exploring the application of ensemble learning and boosting techniques for classification and regression tasks.

**Project Structure:**

* **`Ensemble_Learning.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of:
    * **Task 1**:  **Base Model Implementation**:  Implementing decision trees, logistic/linear regression, and multi-layer perceptrons as base models for classification and regression. 
    * **Task 2**: **Bagging**: Exploring bagging techniques for both classification and regression tasks, experimenting with different hyperparameters and comparing the performance of different base models. 
    * **Task 3**: **Stacking**: Implementing stacking techniques for classification and regression tasks, comparing performance with bagging.

* **`Boosting_and_Comparison.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of:
    * **Task 4**: **Random Forests vs Boosted Trees**: Comparing the performance of random forests with AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting techniques for both classification and regression.

* **`datasets/`**: Folder containing the datasets used for the assignment:
    * `winequality-red.csv`: Dataset for classification tasks.
    * `housing.csv`: Dataset for regression tasks. 

**Instructions:**

1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```
2. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Ensemble_Learning.ipynb 
   jupyter notebook Boosting_and_Comparison.ipynb
   ```
3. **Explore the code:**
   Each notebook provides detailed explanations and code comments, guiding you through the implementation and analysis of each task.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Ensemble Learning:** Combining multiple individual models to improve prediction accuracy.
* **Bagging:**  Creating an ensemble by training multiple models on different subsets of the data.
* **Stacking:**  Creating an ensemble by training a "meta-learner" on the predictions of other models.
* **Random Forests:** A bagging ensemble of decision trees.
* **AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting):**  A boosting algorithm that iteratively weights misclassified examples to improve model performance.
* **Gradient Boosting:**  A boosting algorithm that combines weak learners by minimizing a loss function using gradient descent.

**This assignment provides a practical exploration of ensemble learning and boosting techniques. You can use this repository as a foundation for further learning and experimentation with these powerful tools.**

**Note:** 

This project is for educational purposes and serves as a starting point for further exploration. Feel free to experiment with the code, explore different hyperparameter values, and apply these techniques to different datasets.
